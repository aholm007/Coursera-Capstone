    "## Introduction\n",
    "   Orange County is one of the most populous cities in the US ranking in at 6th according to a 2010 census. It has many attractions such as the original Disneyland and expansive beaches that bring in people from all over the world. Cities within Orange County are home to some of the most diverse and unqiue restaurants incorporating a wide range of cuisines. More than 45 percent of Irvine's population is Asian allowing for a broad array of different asian and asian fusion restaurants to develop. Similarly, in Westminister resides the oldest, largest, and most prominent Little Saigon in the United States meaning this is the place to go to for Vietnamese food. Santa Ana has a lot of Hispanic heritage allowing for high quality mexican restuarants. Orange County has places scattered throughout, such as the 4th street market and the Packing District, where a variety of cultural cuisines, such as mediterranean and pacific island ran by independent owners can be enjoyed in close proximity to eachother. American and Tex-Mex food can be found almost anywhere throughout Orange County and many of these restaurants are award winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this project, we will be exploring potential recommendations for opening up different types of new restaurants. This will be done by looking at the performance of current restaurants in Orange County."

    "## Data\n",
    "   The data provided was taken from the opendatasoft website. The data gives the different latitude and longitude coordinates for all of the zip codes within the Orange County area as well as the city the zip code is associated with. In addition, we will use  both the Foursquare API and GeoSpace for venue data and geospatial data respectively. The Foursquare API will help us get all the venues and their information within a 2km radius of each zip code. The GeoSpace data will allow us to create a choropleth map to help visualize the data.\n",
    "   With the given data, we will look into what are the most frequent restaurants in each area. We will also look at how highly rated a type of restaurant is in relation to how abudant that type of restaurant is.\n",
